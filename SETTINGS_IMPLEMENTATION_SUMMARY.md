- `/settings/features` - Feature toggle management
- `/settings/notifications` - Notification preferences
- `/settings/system` - System-wide configuration (admin only)

## Technology Stack

- React with TypeScript
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- TanStack React Query for data management
- Supabase for backend services
- TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI components
- Deno Edge Functions for server-side processing

## Security Implementation

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- JWT-based authentication with role claims
- Service role key usage for secure database operations
- Data validation at both frontend and backend levels
- Audit logging for all critical operations
- Role-based access control with hierarchical permissions

## Testing

- Integration tests for all settings functionality
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- Role-based access control tests
- Edge Function tests for server-side processing

## Deployment Considerations

- Supabase Postgres database with RLS policies
