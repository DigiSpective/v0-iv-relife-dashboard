# Shipping Route Implementation

This document describes the complete implementation of the `/shipping` route for the IV RELIFE Internal System.

## Overview

The shipping route provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing shipping providers, methods, quotes, and active shipments. It includes multi-role access control, audit logging, and integration with shipping APIs.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard View
- KPIs for active shipments, delayed shipments, and pending fulfillments
- Quick access to create new shipments
- Recent shipments table

### 2. Shipping Providers Management
- CRUD operations for shipping providers (Owner/Backoffice roles only)
- Provider listing with creation/editing capabilities

### 3. Shipping Quotes
- Multi-step quote request form (package details, addresses, provider/method selection)
- Cached quote listing with expiration tracking
- Quote selection for order fulfillment

### 4. Shipments Management
- Fulfillment creation with provider/method assignment
- Tracking number management
- Status tracking with visual indicators

### 5. Role-Based Access Control
- Owners: Full access to all shipping features
- Backoffice: View/manage quotes and fulfillments across all retailers
- Retailers/Location Users: View quotes/fulfillments tied to their retailer/location

### 6. Audit Logging
- Immutable audit logs for all shipping-related changes
- Outbox events for notification processing

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `QuoteRequestForm`: Multi-step form for requesting shipping quotes
- `QuotesList`: Displays cached quotes with selection capability
- `FulfillmentModal`: Modal for creating/editing fulfillments
- `ProvidersTable`: Table for managing shipping providers
- `ShipmentsTable`: Table for viewing active shipments
- `TrackingTimeline`: Visual timeline for shipment tracking events
- `AuditLogWidget`: Widget for displaying audit log entries

### Hooks
- `useShippingProviders`: Fetch and manage shipping providers
- `useShippingMethods`: Fetch and manage shipping methods
- `useShippingQuotes`: Fetch and manage shipping quotes
- `useFulfillments`: Fetch and manage fulfillments
- CRUD hooks for each entity type with proper cache invalidation

### Handlers
- `handleQuoteRequestSubmit`: Validates input and creates shipping quotes
- `handleFulfillmentCreate`: Creates fulfillments and triggers notifications
- `handleTrackingRefresh`: Updates tracking status information
- `handleProviderCreate/Update`: Manages shipping provider data

### Database Schema
- `shipping_providers`: Provider information with API credentials
- `shipping_methods`: Specific shipping methods for each provider
- `shipping_quotes`: Cached shipping quotes with expiration
- `fulfillments`: Active shipment fulfillments with tracking
- `audit_logs`: Immutable audit trail of all changes
- `outbox_events`: Notification events for processing

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for role-based data access
- Private storage for fulfillment documents
- Immutable audit logs for compliance

## Integration Points

### Supabase
- PostgreSQL database with RLS policies
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization

### Shipping APIs
- UPS, FedEx, and LTL carrier integrations
- Edge functions for quote requests and tracking updates

### Notification Services
- Resend (email) and Twilio (SMS) integration
- Outbox pattern for reliable notification delivery

## Testing

Unit tests and integration tests have been implemented to ensure:
- Component rendering and user interactions
- Data fetching and mutation functionality
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Error handling and edge cases

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time tracking updates via Edge Functions
2. PDF contract generation for fulfillments
3. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
4. Bulk shipment operations
5. Carrier integration dashboards
6. Performance analytics and reporting
