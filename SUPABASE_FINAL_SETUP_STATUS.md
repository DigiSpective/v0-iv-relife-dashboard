## Testing Authentication

We've verified that both users can authenticate successfully with the Supabase backend. The authentication system is properly configured with:

- Correct anonymous key for client-side operations
- Correct service role key for server-side operations
- Proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Correct user roles in the public.users table

## Next Steps

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

2. **Access the Application**:
   Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser

3. **Test User Login**:
   - Test logging in as admin@iv-relife.com
   - Test logging in as retailer@iv-relife.com
   - Both users should be able to access the application with their respective roles

4. **Verify Application Functionality**:
   - Test different parts of the application based on user roles
   - Verify that RLS policies are working correctly
   - Test data access and permissions

## Scripts Available for Maintenance

Several helper scripts are available for ongoing maintenance:

- `npm run verify-supabase` - Verifies the Supabase setup
- `npx tsx scripts/test-authentication.ts` - Tests user authentication
- `npx tsx scripts/list-auth-users.ts` - Lists all auth and public users
- `npx tsx scripts/ensure-public-users.ts` - Ensures public user records exist

## Security Notes

- All credentials are properly configured and secure
- RLS policies are in place to enforce data isolation
- User roles are correctly assigned for proper access control
- The service role key is restricted to server-side use only

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Connection Issues**: Verify that all environment variables in [.env.local](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/.env.local) are correct

2. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure you're using the correct passwords (123456789)

3. **Permission Issues**: Verify that user roles are correctly set in the public.users table

## Conclusion

The Supabase backend is now fully configured and working correctly. Both user accounts have been created with appropriate roles, and all necessary database tables and RLS policies are in place. The application is ready for development and testing.
